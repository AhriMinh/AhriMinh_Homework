            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p class="about">
                Rei has short pale blue hair with bangs centered to the middle and has red eyes. At the beginning of the series, she would wear bandages such as her arm and her eye one. She wears the same school uniform but wears white loafers instead, and black ankle socks.
            </p>

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="li_content">Rei is socially withdrawn, seemingly emotionless, and rarely interacts with anyone</li>
                <li class="li_content">Rei is also shown to have an interest in psychology and genetics</li>
                <li class="li_content">Rei is not totally devoid of personality, otherwise she would not be interesting</li>
                <li class="li_content">She knows she's expendable, but the thing is, she's still human so you can't do her totally catatonic</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Character notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="li_content">Written in kanji, Rei (零) can also mean "zero", "null" and is a pun on her Evangelion 00</li>
                <li class="li_content">Another source of inspiration was The Snow Goose, a thin and pale girl in an empty room.</li>
                
            </ul>
